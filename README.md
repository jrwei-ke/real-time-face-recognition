# Real-time-Face-Recognition

This repo refers to [Insight_Face_Paddle](https://github.com/littletomatodonkey/insight-face-paddle) and [Real-time Multi-Camera Facial Recognition](https://github.com/M-M-Akash/Face_Recognition_System). These two repos have a few lib incompatible problems and that is why I bulid this repo to deliver a proper way to build up.

## Enviroment

It is not recommended to use M-series processor for MacOS as base enviroment for the reason that it may report lots of incompatible problems in spite of the compatible announcement from officail website. Win10 and Ubuntu 22.04 are recommended and this repo is operated on ubuntu 22.04 desktop system. 

### Using conda to build virtual environment:

```linux
conda create --name env_name python==3.8
```
[Insight_Face_Paddle](https://github.com/littletomatodonkey/insight-face-paddle) list a range of compatible version of python, however, version 3.8 is strongly suggested.  

### Activate virtual environment:

```linux
conda activate env_name
```

### Install paddlepaddle lib:

CPU version:
```linux
pip install paddlepaddle==2.4.2 -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple 
```
GPU version:
```linux
pip install paddlepaddle==2.4.2-gpu
```

### Install [Insight_Face_Paddle](https://github.com/littletomatodonkey/insight-face-paddle) through wheel:

```linux
pip install wheel  
git clone https://github.com/littletomatodonkey/insight-face-paddle.git  
cd insight-face-paddle  
Python setup.py bdist_wheel  
pip install dist/*  
```

This repo has another way to install by pip. I tried and found lots of incompatible issues for the reason that lots of libs auto installed by pip are getting higher version.  

### Install paddlehub:

```linux
pip install paddlehub==2.1.0
```

This hub is for accessing to pre-trained facial-detection model.

### Version modification for libs:

```linux
pip install protobuf==3.20 
pip install paddlenlp==2.5.2
```

Incompatible result from the auto updating of pip, downgrade version to avoid this problem.

### Install pre-trained facial-detection model

```linux
hub install pyramidbox_lite_mobile
```

### Enroll Face Data

One should build an index for face matching. Before executing, setting the urls for camera. 

Check "camera_urls.json" and "enroll_condition.json". 

The detail of other parameters are described in insightface-paddle.

Excecute the program:

```linux
python enroll_manage_tool.py
```

First, enter the ID of a new person and then the new person who wants to be enrolled should be in front of the camera, 

and rotate his/her face in different angle for about five second and take a moment for another five second,

and move to the other camera untill all the camera enrollment complete.

### Face Recognition

```linux
python face_rec.py
```

A video shows the frame from the camera. If face is detected, a bounding box is drawed and a cofidence score is shown.

If a detected person is in the data pool, the label attached to the bounding box will be the ID which is setting during enrollment.

If not, the label will be "unknown".
